How to Avoid Stripe Account Suspension

Stripe is a powerful payment processor, but many users face unexpected account suspensions. To avoid disruptions in your business, follow these best practices to keep your Stripe account in good standing.

1. Follow Stripeâ€™s Terms of Service

Stripe has strict policies regarding the types of businesses it supports. Before using Stripe, review its Restricted Businesses list to ensure your business model aligns with its guidelines. Selling prohibited items or engaging in high-risk transactions can trigger an account suspension.

2. Maintain a Low Dispute Rate

Chargebacks and disputes can signal risky behavior. To minimize disputes:

Provide clear product descriptions.

Offer excellent customer support.

Use tracking numbers for shipments.

Be transparent about refund and return policies.
A high chargeback rate (typically above 1%) can lead to account termination.

3. Verify Customer Identities

Fraudulent transactions can get your Stripe account flagged. Reduce fraud risks by:

Using Stripe Radar to detect suspicious transactions.

Implementing 3D Secure authentication for card payments.

Avoiding transactions with mismatched billing and shipping addresses.

4. Keep Payment Processing Consistent

Abrupt spikes in transaction volume or amount can trigger fraud alerts. To prevent this:

Scale your transaction volume gradually.

Inform Stripe in advance of major sales events.

Avoid processing payments significantly higher than your usual average.

5. Provide Accurate Business Information

Ensure your business details, including your website, legal entity, and contact information, are up-to-date. Stripe may request verification documents, so be prepared to provide valid identification and business registration documents.

6. Avoid Multiple Accounts Without Approval

Creating multiple Stripe accounts without authorization can lead to a permanent ban. If you need additional accounts for separate businesses, contact Stripe support for approval.

7. Respond Promptly to Stripe Requests

If Stripe flags your account for review, respond quickly with the necessary documentation. Delays in providing requested information can lead to account suspension or termination.
